I still remember the day when I started contributing to coala. I was assigned an
issue and all I wasn't having much of an experience in open-source
contributions. I was lucky to have an awesome community which gave their best
reviews on my PRs. My first PR was the one fixing the coala CI, which was of
most priority at that time. Without wasting any time, I created a PR and added a
lot of changes later on (certainly wasn't a very good PR at first),
[sangamcse][1] kept reviewing the PR until it was perfect. He's also the mentor
for my project now :D

I was so happy after my first contribution was merged, I kept solving more
issues and each coming with better quality PRs. After few months, the gsoc
discussions got started. I loved the coala framework and I was sure that I
want to work either on the core or on the bears. I had a pretty good experience
with the bears and that led me to the project [Improve Generic Bear Quality][2]
which I was sure I would not only love to work on, but I would also be able to
complete it. I instantly started writing the proposal, and submitted it for GSoC
2019.

In the last few days, as a backup plan I also submitted a proposal on
Next Generation Action System. So, in the end, I'm happy to announce that
I'm finally selected for GSoC 2019 with my [Improve Generic Bear Quality][2]
project. I hope for an awesome summer with coala and my mentors [sangamcse][1],
[kriti21][3] and [abhishalya][4].
