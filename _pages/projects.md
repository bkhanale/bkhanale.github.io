I have some few projects which I can share with you.
Here are some which you can check them out.

1. [MasterChef](https://github.com/bkhanale/masterchef-old)

This was one which I had worked on during the CodeChef API Hackathon. It is an
electron app built using CodeChef API and Alibaba cloud services which were made
available free during the Hackathon. I still have the API access which is now
restricted only to few users. But due to unavailibility of the cloud services
this project was discontinued and a part of this is being developed now.

2. Options optimizer using NER

I can't share the source code since this was a part of the internship under
[Quantsapp](https://quantsapp.com). But the model was prepared using Named
Entity Recognition and a solid file seeder prepared using Python. The most of
the work of Information Extraction was automated and a fair amount of accuracy
was achieved at the end of the program.

There are few more projects that I want to mention here but I'm too lazy to
write them now, but I will add them soon. This is just a placeholder for now.
