![Community Bonding](/images/posts/cb.png)

The GSoC bonding period is just about to end, I decided to write this blog post
a bit early because I wanted to start with coding as soon as possible. I was
introduced to the coala-ish way of spending bonding period. The [milestones][ms]
were set in this period, along with the preparation of [cEP][cEP].

I started with writing few codes for the bears, deciding on the possible issues
and difficulties that may arise later on in the coding period. I discussed few
of my doubts with my mentors and we were able to resolve them all. The major
problem to me was the `PEP8Bear - PycodestyleBear` integration. It was
something that was never done before, and was quite innovative on its own.
I started writing few codes in that regard and hopefully I'll be able to do
as I proposed.

During this time I also interacted with fellow students, clearing few doubts
of each other. The maintainers were also fairly active during this time along
with the mentors clearing our doubts on time. I also had a weekly interaction
call with my mentors, I was happy that I was able to personally talk with them.

I guess this wraps up my bonding period, this would be the last post without
code-snippets :wink:. I'm really excited for the coding phase 1, hope to see
you in the next post!
