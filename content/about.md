Hi, I'm Bhushan. I'm currently working as a Tech Intern at
[Turtlemint](https://turtlemint.com).
I've been writing code for about more than 5 years now. I love it, and I hope
I will continue doing it.

To name a few accomplishments, I've been a Google Summer of Code Student at
[coala organization](https://coala.io) and have been very good in competitive
programming. I was a round 3 qualifier for Google codejam.

That's about it. Thanks for reading.
