Hi, I'm Bhushan. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at
[Turtlemint](https://turtlemint.com).
I've been writing code for about more than 5 years now. I love it, and I hope
I will continue doing it.

To name a few accomplishments, I've been a Google Summer of Code Student at
[coala organization](https://coala.io) and have been very good in competitive
programming. I was a round 3 qualifier for Google codejam. Read more about me
on my linkedin profile.

I don't really write a lot, but you can have a look at my blog if you find
something interesting. Also do follow me on my social media channels if you
want to have a chat or something.

Also, do let me know if you find any issues with this site. I do want to make
this theme work for my blogs, but let's see how it goes.
